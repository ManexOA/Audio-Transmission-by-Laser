# Audio Transmission by Laser
Project made for a final year coursework of Robotics Bachelor of Engineering degree at Liverpool Hope University.

## Project description

In this project, a low-cost laser communication system is presented, which integrates a laser diode as a data transmitter, a photodiode to receive the data, and two Arduino boards.
The project aims at designing the connections and code to transmit audio data loaded from an SD card over the laser beam from one Arduino board, and reproduce the audio that receives the other Arduino board through a photodiode, on a speaker. For this purpose, the serial communication of the Arduino boards is used, but instead of communicating them by wire, they are connected wirelessly with a laser and a photodiode.
